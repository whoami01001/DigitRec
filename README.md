# Image Classification Project

![header](visuals/header.jpg)

## Overview
This project involves training and evaluating two machine learning models on different data sources for image classification. The goal is to compare their performance and assess their effectiveness in a specific task.

## Models
- **Data Source Model01**: Trained using Data :The dataset we used is called MNIST. This is a large collection of hand-drawn digits 0 to 9 and is a good dataset to learn image classification on as it requires little to no preprocessing..
- **Data Source Model02**: Trained using prepared Data from Kaggle.
